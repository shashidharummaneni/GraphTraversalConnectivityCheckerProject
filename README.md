# Graph Traversal and Connectivity Checker

This project implements a tool for graph traversal using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) and visualizes the graph traversal process.

## Features
- DFS Traversal with live visualization
- BFS Traversal with live visualization
- Check if a graph is connected
